        long_description: '"We extended the flagship Background Removal feature to StockSpark WEB and Import (increasing reach from 10% to 100% of SSK customers), enabled pay-per-use, customization of backgrounds and a tiered approach to generate more revenue.\n\nGo-to-market of this feature was recurrently cited by leadership as an example to follow. Quality is remarkably low for a new feature - with only 14 incident tickets in 6 months.\n\nBGR added 84k ACV in 6 months + 56k from the APP (sales almost exclusively driven by BGR). With 6k rd-party costs, it\'s a 10-20x markup."',
